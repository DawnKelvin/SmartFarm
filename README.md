## 🧠 AI Model: Crop Yield Prediction

### 🎯 Objective:

Predict total crop yield per plot using historical and real-time sensor data + satellite imagery.

### 📊 Inputs (Features):

* Soil moisture trends
* Air temperature & humidity
* Sunlight exposure (daily average)
* Rainfall & irrigation history
* Fertilizer & pesticide application logs
* Satellite/Camera-derived NDVI (crop health index)
* Plant age and crop type
* Soil pH & nutrients (optional)

### 🤖 AI Model Recommendation:

**Model Type:** Regression
**Suggested Architecture:**

* **Model:** Ensemble of models (Random Forest + LSTM)
* **Why:** Random Forest handles structured sensor data well; LSTM captures time series trends (e.g., moisture, temp over weeks)
